      <small>December, 2020</small>
      <p>
        As I had promised in my first blog
        <a class="link-blog" href="/blog1.html">‘what is dom?’</a> here is a
        blog on ‘DOM manipulation’. In this blog, we will dive more into DOM &
        know what is DOM manipulation & how is it done.
      </p>
      <img class="blog-hero" src="../images/blog2.1.svg" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>
        DOM manipulation is interacting with the DOM API to change/modify the
        HTML document that is to be rendered on the web browser. This HTML
        document can be changed/modified to add elements, remove elements, edit
        elements, move elements around, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        By manipulating the DOM you can create applications that will update the
        data of the page without a refresh, change the layout of a page without
        a refresh. You can shuffle, move or delete elements across the document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many languages are used to manipulate the DOM. We will be using
        Javascript to do so. Consider this HTML document, we will be performing
        DOM manipulation on it:
      </p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog2.2.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>
        To manipulate an element inside the DOM, you need to first select it and
        store a reference to it inside a variable. You can do that by using the
        Query Selectors as follows: (Put this code in the script tag)
      </p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog2.3.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>
        ‘querySelector’ returns a reference to the first match of the selector,
        whereas ‘querySelectorAll’ returns a node list containing references to
        all of the matches of the selector.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should note that when using ‘querySelectorAll’ is a node list and
        not an array. The node list looks like an array, to some extent behaves
        like an array but all the methods that apply to an array don’t apply to
        a node list.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also select the elements using their ‘id’, ‘tag’, or ‘class’.
        These were the older methods, the latest being querySelector as follows:
      </p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog2.4.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>
        Let’s move forward to creating an element and also put in the DOM
        through DOM manipulation. Add the following code at the bottom of your
        existing script (do the same with the other code too):
      </p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog2.5.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>
        We have grabbed our section element with the help of ‘querySelector’. We
        will now create a paragraph element.
      </p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog2.6.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>
        Here, we have a created new paragraph element i.e. ‘newPara’ using the
        method ‘createElement()’. We have then also added some text content to
        our paragraph element by using the property ‘textContent’.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can now append the ‘newPara’ element at the end of our section
        element using the ‘appendChild()’ method:
      </p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog2.7.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>
        To sum up, this part, let’s add a text node to the new paragraph i.e.
        ‘newPara’ we added above. We will create the text node using the method
        ‘document.createTextNode()’ and append it to ‘newPara’ using
        ‘appendChild’ as follows:
      </p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog2.8.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>
        There will be times when you will want to delete some nodes from the
        DOM. Well, this can also be done by manipulating DOM.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will now delete the ‘newPara’ node we have just created. This task
        can be done in two ways:
      </p>
      <p>
        ~> We use the method ‘removeChild()’. To use this method one should know
        the parent node of the node that is to be deleted. E.g. to delete
        ‘newPara’:
      </p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog2.9.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>
        ‘sect’ is the parent node of ‘newPara’. Therefore, here we are removing
        ‘newPara’ by removing the child node of ‘sect’ i.e. ‘newPara’ itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        ~> We use the ‘remove()’ method. The ‘remove()’ is used when we want to
        delete a node-based only a reference to itself. E.g. to delete
        ‘newPara’:
      </p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog2.10.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>
        You should note that this ‘remove()’ method is not supported in older
        browsers, so you’d have to do the following to delete a node:
      </p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog2.11.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>
        Let us now add an event listener to our button element to display a
        “Hello World!” message when clicked on. We will do this by using the
        ‘addEventListener()’ method. This method takes in two parameters, the
        first parameter is the type of event like “click” & the second parameter
        is the function we want to call when the event occurs. E.g. :
      </p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog2.12.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>There is one more way to do this, that being:</p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog2.13.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>Now, let us move on to manipulating styles by manipulating DOM.</p>
      <p>
        We can set properties to directly update elements. We will set some
        styles to the element ‘newPara’ as follows:
      </p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog2.14.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>
        Reload your web page and you’ll see that the styles have been applied to
        the paragraph. If you look at that paragraph in your browser’s Page
        Inspector, you’ll see that these lines are indeed adding inline styles
        to the document.
      </p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog2.15.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>
        We can also set attributes to our elements in our HTML document by DOM
        manipulation. Let us set a class attribute for our section element. For
        this we will use the ‘setAttribute()’ method. This method has two
        arguments, the attribute you want to set on the element & the value you
        want to set it to.
      </p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog2.16.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>
        You can check in the Page Inspector of your web browser to verify that
        the class attribute has been added with the value of ‘container’.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some many methods & properties can be used for DOM manipulation. For a
        detailed explanation of all these methods & properties, you can visit

      <p>Will come up with a new blog soon. Till then, Happy Coding!</p>
