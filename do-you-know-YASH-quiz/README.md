I just made a [`Do You Know YASH?`](https://replit.com/@horsemaker/end-game?embed=1&output=1) quiz app which tests whether my friends know me. You can also make a similar fun quiz for yourself on [repl.it](https://replit.com).

I made this quiz as a part of [neogcamp' level zero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzvhQUIpvvuj5KPnyPyWsvgyzNkX_ACPA). You can refer [this repo](https://github.com/horsemaker/neogcamp-levelZero) for all other codes of neogcamp's level zero.

## Below I have noted down the challenge for this quiz along with the understanding I got after making the quiz:

### challenge
* put a list of questions together
* club everything to make the game
  * use question list
  * and function to put together a quiz
* In your program, create a data structure to hold high scores.
* Show user his score and high scorers.
* Ask the user to send a screenshot if he has beaten the score.

### understanding
* all programs are made up of mini functions and data structures.
* learning to break a program into parts and then sewing them together is the real learning.
* you can use data structures to hold data
