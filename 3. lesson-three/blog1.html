        So have you wondered what exactly is DOM & what does it do? Since I was
        facing a similar question, I tried to go more in-depth and learn about
        DOM. Here I have attempted to summarize what I have learned. I hope it
        interests you.
      </p>

      <p>
        The DOM, or the ‘Document Object Model’ is an internal programmatic
        representation of any web page. Technically DOM is also an API that
        allows us to add, remove or edit elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        To understand what is DOM exactly we need to understand how an HTML
        document is transformed into an interactive web page. The path followed
        here for this transformation is known as the ‘Critical Rendering Path’.
      </p>
      <p>
        The steps in this ‘Critical Rendering Path’ can be mainly divided into
        two important stages, the first being — determining what to render & the
        second being — rendering on the browser. An important component is
        formed between these two stages known as ‘Render Tree’.
      </p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog1.2.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>
        The structure of DOM is represented with what we call ‘node tree’. In
        this node tree, the `html` element forms the root node, which will have
        branches containing children nodes of the elements nested within it, and
        so on. The tree will grow in every branch till it reaches an element
        that has no other element nested in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us understand this with an example, consider this HTML document:
      </p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog1.3.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>
        This document can be represented in the form of a node tree as follows:
      </p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog1.4.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>
        We need to keep in mind some important points about DOM, they being:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. The DOM forms an interface only for valid HTML documents. But, the
        browsers help in correcting the invalid HTML code.
      </p>
      <p>Consider the following HTML document for example:</p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog1.5.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>
        The document is invalid since `head` & `body` element are missing from
        it, but the DOM tree will be formed as:
      </p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog1.6.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>
        2. The DOM acts as a living resource, it can be manipulated or modified
        with the help of Javascript. The browser re-renders the DOM whenever any
        changes take place in the DOM.
      </p>
      <p>Consider our HTML document:</p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog1.7.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>The document is rendered in the browser as:</p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog1.8.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>
        Now, we will manipulate the DOM of this HTML document using Javascript.
        We will add one more paragraph in the document which will read ‘This is
        paragraph 2’.
      </p>
      <p>
        i.e. adding an `p` element node consisting of a ‘This is paragraph 2’
        text node in the DOM.
      </p>
      <p>The script for DOM manipulation:</p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog1.9.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>
        After adding this script to the HTML document, the document will be as
        follows:
      </p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog1.10.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>And the browser output will be as follows:</p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog1.11.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>3. What we see in the browser is the Render Tree & not DOM.</p>
      <p>
        Browser forms its viewport with the help of Render Tree. Render Tree is
        a combination of both — DOM & CSSOM(CSS Object Model). The difference
        between Render Tree and DOM is that the Render Tree only consists of
        what is to be rendered on the screen. It will exclude elements that are
        visually hidden using CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the following HTML document. Here, we have added a style i.e.
        display: none to the `p` tag:
      </p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog1.12.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>
        Since the `p` tag is a part of the HTML document, it will be included in
        the DOM tree as follows:
      </p>
      <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog1.13.png" alt="what is dom?" />
      <p>
        But, when the Render tree is to be formed, it will consider both, the
        DOM and the CSSOM and that will result in excluding the
      </p>
      <p>
        tag of our HTML document since it has been styled to not display itself
        on the browser.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hope this blog helped you understand more about DOM. I will write in
        detail about DOM manipulation in my upcoming blogs.
      </p>
      <p>Till then, Happy Coding!</p>
